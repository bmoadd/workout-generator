A random workout generator based on your split, available splits are Push/Pull/Legs/, Upper/lower.


I only included good high tier workouts for that I took inspiration from [Jeff Nippards workout tier list](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ryh7PNhz3E&list=PLp4G6oBUcv8w8ujRtP5BtvJe8PXBwiTdl) and some of my own preferences.

The way it works is when you slect a certain split it will give you 2 exercises that are always there that i think essential then randomize the latter exercises,
because variety of exercises gives more muscle stimulus than keeping the same exercises and it makes working out more fun. 

I made this program because i can see myself actually using it and it was fun to develop and adjust, I might add more modifications later
